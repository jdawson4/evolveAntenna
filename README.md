# evolveAntenna
The idea here is to either make an evolutionary algorithm (or some other kind of optimiziation algorithm?) in order to design radio antennae to certain parameters!

# Requirements:
1. Python3
2. necpp, a python library I found here: https://github.com/tmolteno/necpp for simulating antenna behavior
3. scipy, for scientific processing. We'll be using its optimization functions to do some quick antenna-designing
